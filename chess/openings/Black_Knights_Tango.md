# Black Knights Tango

The Black Knights Tango is an unconventional chess opening that arises after the moves 1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 Nc6. It is characterized by the early development of the knights and aims to create a flexible and dynamic position. The opening can lead to various pawn structures and tactical opportunities, making it appealing to players who enjoy creative and less common lines.

The main idea behind the Black Knights Tango is to develop the knights to active squares while keeping options open for the other pieces. It can lead to a variety of transpositions into other openings, depending on how White responds. 

Some common continuations for White include:

1. 3. d4 (the most common response) - leading to an open game.
2. 3. Nf3 - developing another knight and preparing to control the center.
3. 3. Bb5 - pinning the knight on c6 and putting pressure on the center.

The Black Knights Tango can be a surprise weapon against opponents who are less familiar with it, and it often leads to rich tactical play. Players who enjoy dynamic and flexible positions may find this opening particularly appealing.
