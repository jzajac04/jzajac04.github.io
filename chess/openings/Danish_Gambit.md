# Danish Gambit

The Danish Gambit is an aggressive and tactical chess opening that arises after the moves:

1. e4 e5  
2. Nf3 Nc6  
3. c3

In this opening, White offers one or two pawns in exchange for rapid development and attacking chances. If Black accepts the gambit, the game can continue with:

3... d5  
4. exd5 Qxd5  
5. c4

At this point, White has sacrificed two pawns for quick development and aims to create threats against the Black king. The Danish Gambit can lead to very sharp and tactical positions, making it a favorite among players who enjoy aggressive play.

The main ideas for White include developing pieces quickly, often with moves like d4 and Bb5+, and launching an attack against the Black king. Black, on the other hand, can choose to accept the gambit and try to consolidate their extra material or decline it and focus on solid development.

While the Danish Gambit is not as commonly played at the highest levels of chess, it can be a fun and effective weapon in club play or for players looking to surprise their opponents with an aggressive opening.
