# Max Lange Attack

The Max Lange Attack is an aggressive and tactical variation that arises from the Italian Game, specifically from the Giuoco Piano. It is named after the German chess player Max Lange, who contributed to its development in the 19th century. The Max Lange Attack is characterized by White's early pawn sacrifice to gain rapid development and create attacking chances against Black's position.

### Moves Leading to the Max Lange Attack:

3. **Bc4 Bc5**
4. **c3** (This move prepares to support the center and can lead to the Max Lange Attack.)
5. **d4 exd4**
6. **cxd4** (This is where the Max Lange Attack begins, as White sacrifices a pawn for quick development.)

### Key Ideas:

- **Aggressive Play**: The Max Lange Attack aims to create immediate tactical opportunities for White. By sacrificing the pawn, White seeks to gain rapid development and control of the center.
