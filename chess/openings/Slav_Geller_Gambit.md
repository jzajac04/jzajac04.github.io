# Slav Geller Gambit

The Slav Geller Gambit is an aggressive variation of the Slav Defense that arises after the following moves:

1. d4 d5  
2. c4 c6  
3. Nf3 Nf6  
4. Nc3 e6  
5. g3 dxc4  
6. Bg2 b5

In this position, Black plays 6... b5, offering a pawn as a gambit to gain active piece play and create imbalances in the position. The gambit is named after the Soviet grandmaster Efim Geller, who was known for his contributions to opening theory.

### Key Ideas and Concepts:

1. **Active Piece Play**: The Geller Gambit aims to create dynamic play for Black by sacrificing a pawn. The idea is to generate counterplay and active piece development, often leading to sharp tactical positions.

2. **Central Control**: By playing ...b5, Black seeks to undermine White's pawn structure and challenge the center, while also preparing to fianchetto the light-squared bishop.

3. **Imbalances**: The gambit leads to imbalanced positions where both sides have chances, making it an interesting choice for players who enjoy tactical battles.

### Common Variations:

1. **Main Line**: After 7. Ne5, White can try to maintain pressure in the center. Black can respond with 7... Bb7, developing the bishop and increasing pressure on the center.

2. **7. O-O**: White can also choose to castle, aiming for a solid setup while keeping options open for future development.

3. **7. a4**: Another option for White is to play 7. a4, trying to prevent ...b4 and maintain control over the b5 square.

### Strategic Considerations:

- The Slav Geller Gambit is less common at the highest levels of chess compared to other openings, but it can be a useful weapon in club play or faster time controls, where opponents may be less familiar with the resulting positions.
- Players who enjoy sharp, tactical battles may find the Geller Gambit to be an exciting choice, as it can lead to imbalanced positions and opportunities for both sides.

Overall, the Slav Geller Gambit is an interesting and aggressive option for players looking to create dynamic play and challenge their opponents in the early stages of the game. It offers opportunities for tactical battles and can catch opponents off guard.
