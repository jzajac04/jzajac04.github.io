# Traxler Counter Attack

The Traxler Counterattack, also known as the Wilkes-Barre Variation, is an aggressive and tactical response to the Italian Game. It arises after the following moves:

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Bc5
4. Nxe5

At this point, instead of playing a more conventional move, Black plays:

4...Bc5

This move sacrifices the f7 pawn, aiming to create immediate counterplay against White's position. The Traxler Counterattack is known for its sharp and tactical nature, often leading to complex positions where both sides must be careful.

### Key Ideas of the Traxler Counterattack:

1. **Aggressive Play**: The Traxler Counterattack is designed to catch White off guard and create immediate threats. Black aims to exploit the weaknesses in White's position, particularly targeting the f2 pawn.

2. **Tactical Opportunities**: The opening can lead to sharp tactical battles, where both players must be alert to potential threats and combinations. It often results in double-edged positions.

3. **Surprise Factor**: The Traxler Counterattack is less common than other lines in the Italian Game, which can catch opponents unprepared, especially if they are not familiar with the intricacies of the resulting positions.

### Typical Continuations:

After 4...Bc5, White has several options, but one of the most common is:

5. Nxf7

This move captures the f7 pawn, putting pressure on Black's position. Black can respond with:

5...Bxf2+

This leads to a sharp and tactical position where both sides have chances for counterplay. The game can quickly become very complicated, with both players needing to navigate potential traps and tactics.

### Conclusion:

The Traxler Counterattack is an exciting and aggressive choice for players looking to create dynamic positions and challenge their opponents. It is particularly effective in faster time controls, where the complexities of the position can lead to mistakes. Players who enjoy tactical battles and unconventional openings may find the Traxler Counterattack to be a fun addition to their repertoire.
