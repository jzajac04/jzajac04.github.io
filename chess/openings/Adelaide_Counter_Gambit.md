# Adelaide Counter Gambit

The Adelaide Counter-Gambit is an aggressive and somewhat unconventional chess opening that arises after the following moves:

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 d6
3. d4 Bg4

In this opening, Black offers a pawn sacrifice with 3...Bg4, aiming to create imbalances and generate active piece play. The idea is to lure White into capturing the pawn on d4, which can lead to a dynamic and tactical game.

After 3...Bg4, White typically has a few options, including:

- 4. dxe5, accepting the gambit.
- 4. Be2, which avoids the gambit and prepares to develop pieces.
- 4. Nc3, which also supports the center.

If White accepts the gambit with 4. dxe5, Black can continue with 4...dxe5, and the game can become quite sharp, with chances for both sides.

The Adelaide Counter-Gambit is not as popular as some other openings, but it can catch opponents off guard and lead to interesting positions. It is particularly favored by players looking for a tactical and aggressive approach.
