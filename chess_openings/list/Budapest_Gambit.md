The Budapest Gambit is an aggressive chess opening that arises after the moves:

1. d4 Nf6  
2. c4 e5  

In this opening, Black sacrifices a pawn early on in exchange for rapid development and active piece play. The idea is to create imbalances and put pressure on White's position, often leading to dynamic and tactical positions.

After 2...e5, White typically has a few options, with the most common being:

- 3. dxe5, accepting the gambit. This leads to positions where Black can quickly develop their pieces and create threats against White's center.
- 3. Nf3, which avoids taking the pawn and allows White to maintain a solid position.
- 3. d5, which can lead to a more closed position.

The Budapest Gambit is less common at the highest levels of play but can be a surprise weapon in club play and online games. It is particularly appealing for players who enjoy tactical battles and are willing to take risks for the sake of initiative and piece activity.
