The Steinitz Gambit is a chess opening that arises from the Philidor Defense, specifically after the following moves:

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 d6
3. d4 Nd7
4. dxe5 dxe5
5. Bc4

At this point, Black can choose to play 5...Ngf6, leading to the Steinitz Gambit. The gambit involves Black sacrificing a pawn for active piece play and counterattacking chances.

### Key Ideas of the Steinitz Gambit:

- **Active Piece Play**: By sacrificing the pawn, Black aims to develop their pieces rapidly and create threats against White's position.
- **Counterplay**: The gambit allows Black to generate counterplay and create imbalances in the position, which can lead to tactical opportunities.
- **Surprise Value**: The Steinitz Gambit is less common than other openings, which can catch opponents off guard, especially if they are not familiar with the resulting positions.

### Typical Continuations:

After 5...Ngf6, White can respond in various ways, but a common continuation is 6. Ng5, attacking the f7 pawn and putting pressure on Black's position. Black must be careful to defend against threats while trying to exploit the initiative gained from the gambit.

### Conclusion:

The Steinitz Gambit is an interesting and aggressive choice for players looking to create dynamic positions and challenge their opponents. While it may not be as popular as other openings, it can lead to exciting and tactical games, especially in faster time controls.
