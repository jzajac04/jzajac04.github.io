The Cochrane Gambit is an aggressive and somewhat unconventional chess opening that arises from the Philidor Defense. It is named after the Scottish player John Cochrane, who was known for his creative and tactical play in the 19th century.

The Cochrane Gambit is characterized by the following moves:

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 d6
3. d4 Bg4
4. dxe5 Bxf3
5. Qxf3 dxe5

In this position, Black has accepted the gambit by capturing the pawn on e5. The idea behind the Cochrane Gambit is to sacrifice a pawn in exchange for rapid development and attacking chances against the Black king. White aims to create threats and complications that can lead to a strong initiative.

The Cochrane Gambit is not as commonly played as other openings, but it can catch opponents off guard and lead to interesting tactical positions. Players who enjoy sharp, tactical play may find this gambit appealing. However, it requires a good understanding of the resulting positions and tactics to navigate the complexities that arise.
