The Baltic Defense is a chess opening that arises after the moves 1.e4 c5. It is a variation of the Sicilian Defense, where Black aims to counter White's central control with the pawn on c5. The Baltic Defense is characterized by its aggressive nature and can lead to sharp positions.

After 1.e4 c5, the most common continuation for White is 2.Nf3, followed by 3.d4, leading to an open game. Black can respond with various setups, including developing pieces quickly and aiming for counterplay against White's center.

The Baltic Defense is less common than other Sicilian variations, such as the Najdorf or Dragon, but it can catch opponents off guard and lead to interesting tactical battles. Players who enjoy dynamic and unbalanced positions may find the Baltic Defense appealing.

Overall, while it may not be as popular as other Sicilian lines, it offers Black a solid and aggressive way to challenge White's opening strategy.
