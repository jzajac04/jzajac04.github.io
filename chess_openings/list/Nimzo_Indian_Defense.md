The Nimzo-Indian Defense is a highly respected and strategically rich chess opening that arises after the following moves:

1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e6
3. Nc3 Bb4

In this opening, Black aims to control the center and create imbalances in the pawn structure. The Nimzo-Indian Defense is named after the famous chess player Aron Nimzowitsch, who was a key figure in the hypermodern movement and contributed significantly to chess theory in the early 20th century.

### Key Ideas and Concepts:

1. **Control of the Center**: By playing ...e6 and ...Nf6, Black prepares to challenge White's central pawns while keeping options open for piece development.

2. **Bishop on b4**: The move ...Bb4 pins the knight on c3, which can create tension in the center and potentially lead to doubled pawns for White if the knight is exchanged.

3. **Flexibility**: The Nimzo-Indian Defense allows Black to adopt various pawn structures and plans, depending on White's responses. Black can choose to play ...d5, ...c5, or even ...f5 in some lines.

4. **Rich Tactical and Strategic Play**: The Nimzo-Indian often leads to complex middlegame positions where both sides have chances. It requires deep understanding and preparation, making it a favorite among many top-level players.

### Common Variations:

1. **Classical Variation**: After 4. Qd3, White aims to support the center and prepare for e4.
2. **Rubinstein Variation**: After 4. e3, White opts for a solid setup, allowing for flexible development.
3. **Samisch Variation**: After 4. f3, White aims for a strong center but can lead to a more closed position.
4. **Tartakower (or Averbakh) Variation**: After 4. Nf3, White develops the knight and prepares to support the center.

The Nimzo-Indian Defense is a favorite among many grandmasters and is known for its deep strategic ideas and rich tactical possibilities. It is a great choice for players looking to create imbalances and challenge their opponents in the opening phase of the game.
