The King's Gambit is one of the oldest and most aggressive openings in chess, beginning with the moves:

1. **e4 e5**
2. **f4**

In this opening, White offers a pawn on f4 to gain rapid development and control of the center, aiming for a quick attack on Black's position. While the King's Gambit can lead to exciting and tactical games, it also requires Black to be prepared to counter White's aggressive intentions effectively.

### Key Ideas for Countering the King's Gambit:

1. **Accepting the Gambit**:
   - **2... exf4**: This is the most straightforward response, accepting the gambit. After this, Black can aim to consolidate their position and develop pieces actively. Common continuations include:
     - **3. Nf3**: White aims to recover the pawn with development. Black can respond with **3... d6** or **3... g5** to hold onto the pawn.
     - **3. d4**: This move aims to open the center. Black can respond with **3... Qh4+**, putting pressure on White's position.

2. **Declining the Gambit**:
   - **2... d5**: This is a solid way to counter the King's Gambit without accepting the pawn. It challenges White's center directly and can lead to a more stable position for Black.
   - **2... Nf6**: This move develops a piece and prepares to counterattack. After 3. e5, Black can play **3... Nd5**, targeting the e5 pawn and maintaining a solid position.

3. **Counterattacking**:
   - After accepting the gambit, Black should aim to develop pieces quickly and look for counterplay. Moves like ...d6, ...Nf6, and ...g5 can help solidify Black's position while preparing for potential counterattacks.

### General Considerations:

- **Development**: In the King's Gambit, it is crucial for Black to develop pieces harmoniously and not get too greedy with the pawn. Rapid development can help counter White's aggressive intentions.
- **King Safety**: Be mindful of king safety, especially if White launches an early attack. Consider castling early to ensure the king's safety.
- **Tactical Awareness**: The King's Gambit often leads to sharp tactical positions. Both sides must be alert to threats and opportunities, as mistakes can be costly.

### Conclusion:

Countering the King's Gambit requires a mix of solid defensive play and active counterattacking strategies. By accepting or declining the gambit and focusing on rapid development and king safety, Black can effectively neutralize White's aggressive intentions and seek to seize the initiative. Understanding the key ideas and typical plans in the King's Gambit can lead to exciting and rewarding games.
