The Stonewall Attack is a solid and strategic chess opening system that can be played by White, characterized by a specific pawn structure. It typically arises after the following moves:

1. d4 d5
2. Nf3 Nf6
3. e3 e6
4. Bd3 c5
5. c3

In this setup, White aims to establish a strong pawn formation with pawns on d4 and e3, and often f4, creating a "stonewall" structure. The Stonewall Attack can also be reached through various move orders, but the key features remain the same.

### Key Ideas of the Stonewall Attack:

1. **Solid Pawn Structure**: The Stonewall structure provides a strong central presence and can be difficult for Black to break down. The pawns on d4 and e3 support each other and control key central squares.

2. **Piece Development**: White typically develops the pieces behind the pawn structure, with the light-squared bishop on d3 and the knight often coming to f3 or e5. The dark-squared bishop may be developed to e2 or f3, depending on the position.

3. **Attacking Chances**: The Stonewall Attack often leads to aggressive play on the kingside, with ideas of launching a pawn storm with f4 and g4, and potentially opening lines against Black's king.

4. **Flexibility**: The Stonewall Attack is a flexible system that can be adapted to various responses from Black. It can be played against different defenses, including the King's Indian Defense, the Dutch Defense, and others.

### Typical Plans for White:

- **Pawn Storm**: After establishing the Stonewall structure, White can consider advancing the pawns on the kingside (f4, g4) to create attacking chances.
- **Central Control**: Maintaining control of the center with the pawns and pieces is crucial, as it allows for better piece mobility and coordination.
- **Piece Coordination**: White should aim to coordinate the pieces effectively, often looking for opportunities to place knights on strong squares like e5.

### Conclusion:

The Stonewall Attack is a popular choice for players who prefer a solid and strategic approach to the game. It can lead to rich middlegame positions with various tactical and strategic possibilities. While it may not be as aggressive as some other openings, it offers good chances for both positional play and attacking opportunities.
