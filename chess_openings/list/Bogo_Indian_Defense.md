The Bogo-Indian Defense is a chess opening that arises after the moves:

1. d4 Nf6  
2. c4 e6  
3. Nf3 Bb4+

In this opening, Black aims to create a solid position while also putting pressure on White's center. The move 3...Bb4+ is a check that forces White to respond, typically by blocking the check with 4. Bd2 or 4. Nbd2. 

The Bogo-Indian Defense is named after the Soviet grandmaster Efim Bogoljubov, who was one of the early proponents of this opening. It is considered a hypermodern defense, as Black allows White to occupy the center with pawns while planning to undermine and attack that center later.

Key ideas for Black in the Bogo-Indian include:

- Developing pieces harmoniously while keeping the pawn structure flexible.
- Potentially exchanging the dark-squared bishop for White's knight on f3, which can help to weaken White's control of the center.
- Aiming for a solid and resilient pawn structure, often leading to a rich middlegame with chances for both sides.

The Bogo-Indian Defense can lead to various pawn structures and middlegame plans, making it a versatile choice for players looking for a solid yet dynamic response to 1.d4.
