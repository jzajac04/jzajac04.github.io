The Alekhine Defense is a chess opening that arises after the moves 1.e4 Nf6. Named after the former World Champion Alexander Alekhine, this defense is characterized by Black's provocative strategy of allowing White to build a strong pawn center with the intention of undermining it later.

### Key Ideas:
1. **Provocation**: By playing 1...Nf6, Black invites White to advance their pawns (typically with 2.e5), which can lead to overextension.
2. **Counterplay**: Black aims to challenge White's center with moves like ...d5 and ...c5, often leading to dynamic and unbalanced positions.
3. **Flexibility**: The Alekhine Defense allows Black to remain flexible in their pawn structure and piece development, often leading to rich tactical opportunities.

### Main Variations:
1. **Four Pawns Attack**: After 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.Nf3, White aims for a strong center.
2. **Exchange Variation**: After 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.exd6, White exchanges pawns, leading to a more open position.
3. **Modern Variation**: After 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.Nf3 Bg4, Black develops the bishop actively, pinning the knight.

### Strategic Themes:
- **Pawn Structure**: Black often looks to undermine White's pawn center with moves like ...c5 and ...f6.
- **Piece Activity**: Black seeks to develop pieces actively, often leading to counterattacks against White's center.
- **Dynamic Play**: The positions that arise from the Alekhine Defense can be very dynamic, with chances for both sides.

The Alekhine Defense is less common at the top levels compared to other defenses, but it can lead to interesting and complex positions, making it a favorite for players looking for unorthodox and aggressive play.
